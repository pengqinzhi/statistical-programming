THESE CONSTRAINTS NEED TO BE ADDED!

EMPLOYEE:
	* Employed by 1 department
	* 1 employee from that department is manager
	* Employee can supervise and be supervised
	* CEO Supervies top-level employee of each department
		- The employee in a department who is supervised by CEO is top-level


CLIENT:
	* Current clients(have projects) and potential clients(no projects) are kept 

PROJECT:
	* Each project belongs to only 1 department
	* Administration dept. does not run any projects
	* Start date and total cost recorded
	* Total cost is only recorded after project is complete
		- A WIP project will have total cost = NULL
	* Requires 1 SKILL(fk = Code)
	

ASSIGNMENT: 
	* Each assignment can have several employees(many employees working on single project)
	* New Employees are not assigned to project until after a few months
	* Assignments are recorded on month by month basis
		- So the same project #123, can have 2 different assignments if it took 2 months to complete
	* Each row in assignment could be something like this
		| assignment#1 | proj#1 | emp#1 | date_assigned | date_ended(end of month) | total hours in month|
		| assignment#1 | proj#1 | emp#2 | date_assigned | date_ended(end of month) | total hours in month|

	So for each month of an  assignment; every employee assigned to that asssignment will have a row with dates and # of hours
	* IF assignment is WIP, BOTH end date and # hours == NULL 


SKILLS:
	* List of desired skills is kept
	* Not all of the skills will be represented among employees
		- Maybe no employee has the skills "breadmaking"
	* Employees acquire skills through TRAINING



TRAINING:
	* Contains FK "Code" referencing the SKILL code that the employee(EMP_NUM) acquired through the training session(TRAIN_NUM)
	* Date the training was completed AKA skill acquired is recorded
	* Comment regarding the training is recorded
	* Employee can take same training more than once --- the record will be UPDATED
