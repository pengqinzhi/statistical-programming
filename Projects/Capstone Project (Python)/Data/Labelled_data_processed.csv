"Hi Wayne,



Unfortunately, that is not a field that can be populated on the Report Header, or any other form, so we had to create a Custom Field (Custom 5) on the Employee Form which needs to be populated by ITG’s system.

We then can use that field to copy down to the Report Header Custom Field 5 which will populate your Accounting Extract.



Thanks,

Lynn

Thanks so much!  Is there a way to have all travel approvals done by the users’ managers?



After discussing some of the issues with my manager, we agree that I should not be approving travel for anyone and those approvals should be sent to the managers.

Wie ist da der korrekte Vorgang? Können Sie mir weiterhelfen.

"Bonjour,



J’ai reçu plusieurs email puisque la date de transaction de mes factures ne sont pas les mêmes que les dates de réclamations demandé. Ceci est dû au fait que ma date d’embauche est le 25 septembre 2017 et que les formations de Deloitte ont été suivi durant l’été, donc avant ma date d’embauche. Quand j’ai essayé d’entrer les dates avant ma dates d’embauche le système Concur ne m’a pas l’laisser faire, donc j’ai mis la dates de ces remboursements coïncident avec ma date d’embauche.



N’hésitez pas à me rejoindre sur Skype pour toutes questions,

"Hey Elizabeth!


Thanks for reaching out to Pura, I'm sorry for the confusion with your rewards discount code!


With rewards, points can only be redeemed and used on subscription orders. Once you redeem your points, you will not have to do anything! The code will automatically be applied to your upcoming subscription order and as soon as it is processed the amount that you redeemed will be taken off.


I looked into your account and it looks like that rewards discount code RDLQ6JDF for $20 off has been applied to your subscription order set to go out Jan. 1st with two Volcano fragrances in the order.


If you would like I can remove the code and add those 400 points back back into your account. Just let me know if that works better.

"Jeffrey,
I just tried to call, but must have missed you. Divvy goes a step above what most expense management platforms are able to do, and I would love to show you the platform, and learn a little bit more about your process.
Here are some highlights of Divvy:
1. Eliminates expense reports: no more chasing down reports, receipts, or issuing reimbursements ( ).
2. Prevents overspending by ""Divvying"" money to, and assigning spenders to, budgets (hence our name).
3. Improves security with unlimited virtual credit cards (assign each vendor their own card with charge limits - ).
4. Saves on travel: we beat sites like Hotels.com and Expedia by 15-50% with .
5. 1% Cash Back on purchases
Not to mention Divvy is 100% FREE.

"Hi Rica,



My reply in bold



""As I have checked,the reason why there is a discrepancy on the amount that should have been credited to AMEX, its because the meals should have been included in the itemization created for the Hotel expense. Upon the creation of the Meals expenses on the report, these were created as Cash transactions, therefore the SGD 1,004.70 will be reimbursed to you instead. Only SGD 210.90 needs to be paid back to AMEX though at this point and not SGD 1,004.70.""



Am I supposed to pay AMEX first and wait for the reimbursed SGD1004.70? When will I receive the reimbursement? Please reply ASAP because the credit card deadline is end April 2016.



“Are you given daily allowances for meals for SGD 90.00/day?”



Yes given



Moving forward, how to prevent this expense claims situation? The “ do not reimburse” in the concur system does not work at all when the hotels charge the room rates and meals in one single transaction.

"Hi Michelina,



I will be your contact for Danske Bank on this case.



The setups to Concur for DK, FI and SE are completely standard from our side. We also have Lundbeck Pharma A/S set up for Concur. We have one Delivery ID for each company, so it will be one file for each of the new companies. We cannot send the transactions as test transactions, so they will have to be test marked in Concur. As far as I know, this is not a problem.



If we are to send transactions to Concur for UK, IE, ITx2 and PLx2, then I need to know some more about the Mastercard agreements for these companies. I need to know either the Mastercard agreement number or the Mastercard account number for each of the companies to check if we are already sending data for these into Mastercard SmartData, or to set up the data feed if we are not.

Me again, still have questions about the expense reports transferring to QB.

"Good morning

I am somewhat surprised on your comment on this expense report  and would like to clarify what the problems are.
May be I am not reading correctly your message because it is very difficult to understand which comments belongs to which expense as the text is written with no line return.

1. Business line
The date that is appearing on my report are either the date of the invoice or the date at which the invoice is due .  I have used this scheme since the beginning of Concur implementation and never got any negative comment.
So which date do you want to see on the expense: my payment date,  the date of the invoice, the date of the service invoiced or the date at which the invoice is showing as last payment date ( they are all different and valid from an accounting perspective) ?
The part charged is only the business line and not the calls. I attach the split for the business line so that you can verify this value of 35.92 for both June and August.

2. Tolls for 5€
this toll is a toll from Parc de St Cloud which is of 5€. I claimed 5 euros. So I don’t understand your comment.
I do not have the receipt anymore because you have it. So I include a copy of the web site which shows that the toll is indeed of 5€.
Another 5 € expense is  appearing in my expense report as parking but this is a different receipt.

3. Computer peripherals for 44.75€.
This purchase is for ink cartridge for my HBO printer and batteries for my HBO mouse if I recall correctly. These have been purchased from Bureau vallée as the Paris office was not able to provide them.

I have supplied you with the Bureau vallée invoice which shows this total expense value of 44.75€. And I claim these 44.75€.
I don’t understand what is the problem with this expense. Can you clarify?

Thanks in advance

"Hi,



I have submitted an expense report for a couple of charges to my personal card.  They were returned because I don’t have a receipt ($30 for airline baggage and 46.77 for rental car).  I have submitted my credit card receipt for both of these.  I understand that I need to complete a missing receipt affidavit as well, but the system won’t allow me to click on the missing receipt link.  Can you please let me know how I can proceed?

Case Subject : Deleting a booking line in expense report


Case Comment : Hello Silke,

Thank you for contacting SAP Concur admin support regarding this case.

To be able to delete trip segments without creating an expense for it you will need to enable this function in Site Settings.

Please follow the steps below:

Click > Administration > Expense > Expense Admin > Site Settings > Tick ""Allow users to remove trip segments without creating expenses"" > Save.

This will allow Tom the ability to delete the trip segment from Available Expenses when they select it.

For any further assistance, please do not hesitate to ask.

Kind regards,

3. Base on file attached showing the different rate for each expense type, please assist to set them up on  test instance of Concur so that we could used for this UAT testing to confirm functionality.

Question : in the event that Receipt Domestic multiple at expense line is selected, will it allow itemisation by 8% & 10%

The receipt type would not change how it is calculated but what if user do not have a receipt, then we should not be apply the tax rate. In such scenario, does it mean that ""no receipt"" has to be selected. thus the field for selecting rate/receipt type would has to be visible to the users for these expense type.

Just wanted to verify that the highlighted items in the attached screenshot should be:

ADX Corporate is 001

Looks like excel did something weird so I went through and compared the segments to the existing list items and these stuck out. I don't see anything else but that will come up as an error if there are any other discrepancies.

Be on the lookout for a $100 Divvy credit card in the next few days. I just sent it out in the mail this week. Follow the instructions in the card to spend the money. Eager to have you experience Divvy! We are helping companies, like Cache Valley Electric, overcome challenges with expense management:

- Tracking down receipts
- Lack of big picture financial visibility
- Not knowing who is using or where the corporate cards are being spent
- Potential fraud due to the high number of vendors your CC is attached to

By the way, our software is 100% free. Seriously.

Thank you for getting back to me but I've already given an the same explanation twice when submitted both times in the comment box regarding why you can't see the amount of the receipt, can you not access to review it, again I've listed below.



""I do not have another copy for the attached receipt; unfortunately the amount got wet & washed off but it was the same for the rest of my train travel days with new look""




The amount wouldn't have been altered seeing as I was doing work experience with new look from 9th may to 25th may doing the same journey everyday as seen on the other attached receipts.

Can this please be sorted as I do not want to continue stating the same comment claim multiple times?

"Hey Rhonda,




I'm so sorry for the delayed response to your email, I was out of the office. I see that one side seems to be going through fragrance faster than the other. Does it seem like one side gets hotter than the other?




I can go into your account and cancel your subscription for you while you go through the current fragrances you have, or I can go ahead and change the ship date to one further out. Which one would work best for you?




I look forward to hearing from you soon.

"Hi E,




Thanks for contacting Pura Customer Care. My name is Nicole and I'll be helping you out today!




I'm so sorry to hear that you are missing some items from your order, I'm happy to help you find or replace these fragrances.




The fragrances you ordered should be found on the right side of the device box. Each box holds up to 4 fragrances, often times fragrances are packaged underneath each other. Especially under the white flap, there is a tab you can use to pull this flap out (please see attached diagram).

I'm so sorry to hear that you are missing some items from your order, I'm happy to help you find or replace these fragrances.
The fragrances you ordered should be found on the right side of the device box. Each box holds up to 4 fragrances, often times fragrances are packaged underneath each other. Especially under the white flap, there is a tab you can use to pull this flap out (please see attached diagram).

"All too often, people talk about rural America in terms of what we don’t have. We’re moving beyond that — and we’re not alone.







Hello—

A new year offers the opportunity for a reset.

The calendar no longer feels like a countdown with time running out, but a new canvas filled with possibilities. It’s the ideal time to refresh perspectives, identify new goals, and map out the year ahead. And at the Center on Rural Innovation, the transition to 2022 has put one theme front and center:

Epic opportunity.

All too often, people talk about rural America in terms of what we don’t have. We’re moving beyond that — and we’re not alone. More organizations are waking up to the prospect that technology can spark a rural renaissance in the 21st century.

As the perfect kickoff, we announced this month that , will be the pilot site for , an initiative that will empower more rural places to benefit from everything that broadband access and the growing digital economy has to offer. This project, , came to life because the visionary leaders of our partner organizations understand that rural economies need to be strong and diversified if they hope to succeed for decades to come. They see small cities like Aberdeen as a place of opportunity, a chance to show other leaders and policymakers what the future of rural economic development can look like across the country. They believe, as we do, that the jobs of the future can and should be able to .

We’ve also seen more stories that illustrate the ways rural America is evolving and upending inaccurate stereotypes, too.

The next time you hear someone talking about how rural America isn’t diverse, you should point out that the latest Census data shows it is actually more diverse than ever: Nearly a quarter of rural residents — 24% — are people of color. This month, we spoke with NPR for a story about , where this ongoing demographic shift has resulted in a five-person city council that now has four members from its growing Latinx community. The example isn’t an outlier, either: 10% of rural counties are now majority people of color, according to .

These narrative-busting examples are essential when it comes to recognizing that rural America is not white America, as well as realizing the vibrancy and transformative potential that this diversity provides to so many rural communities.

Along the same lines, CORI, in collaboration with , released several pieces of research this month funded by the , which had the incredible foresight to ask us to dig deeper to understand where and how their resources — and the rest of the economic development community — can have the greatest impact in bringing technology jobs to . In addition to examining the economic development approaches used by around the country, there is a series of on topics like the , the , , and the geography of innovation. This work will be the focus of a virtual we are hosting on Feb. 17 — you can to be a part of this event.

Supported by new partners and amazing new communities, with new research and data to draw from, it’s truly an exhilarating moment to be working in and for rural America. The momentum is only growing. At the dawn of this new year, now is the time to make the most of this incredible opportunity.

Join the Conversation: Future-Focused
Economic Development in Rural America





On Feb. 17, we are hosting , moderated by our director of research and knowledge, Mark Rembert, that delves into how technology is changing rural economies and how local leaders are responding. And three of those leaders — Ela Kakde, Stacy Nimmo, and Kathy Wyatt — will be sharing from with future-focused rural economic development in their communities.

We hope you can to join us for the discussion!



This conversation expands on our latest research, supported by funding from into some of the trends affecting economic development in rural America. For more on some of these topics, check out the following reports released earlier this month:

: This report addresses what we have learned about remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as what remote work in rural America looked like before, how remote work changed during the pandemic, and what it may look like in the future.



: This report looks at the growth of gig and independent work, and digs into the scope, scale, opportunities, and risks of the gig economy in the context of rural America.



: Our most recent report explores the question of how automation has impacted, is impacting, and will continue to impact rural America in the coming years, and breaks down these trends across occupations, industries, places and people.

Hello Audit Support,

I received the attached comment regarding my expense statement. The rental car costs were rejected with the reason, that renting a GPS is not allowed. I believe that this is wrong.

Please take a look at page 4 of the travel policy (see attachment). There it is stated, that renting a GPS is allowed if required for safety reasons. This was the case because I was travelling in a foreign country and needed the guidance.

Please approve my expense statement.

Please approve my expense statement.

"Hi Rebecca, I need to keep this ticket open - I have resubmitted the report 4 or 5 times now with a receipt attached each time. I have updated the itemized report with check in/check out dates each time and the correct receipt attached. Each time I save the report with the check in dates listed as 2/24 check in, 2/25 check out, the report then updates the transaction date to 2/24/20 which is not accurate. The transaction dates was 2/12/20 and the check in dates is 2/24 with check out happening 2/25/20. This appears to be a bug in your software and it's kicking back the report every time I submit. Its now been 2 weeks that this has been happening with no clear resolution.

Can this please be escalated so this report can be submitted and reimbursed? It's really imperative that this processes in time.

"Joseph,

I’ve tried to reach you a few times to get started with so we can help your company eliminate expense reports but haven’t heard back, which tells me one of three things:

You’re all set, enjoy doing expense reports and I should stop bothering you. (If so, let me know)

You’re still interested but haven’t had the time to get back to me yet. In that case, here's my calendar to book a time:

You’ve fallen and can’t get up. In that case, please let me know and I’ll call someone to help. :)



Hope all is well Joseph, thanks for letting me know the best steps for moving forward.

Alex

Hi there 

I have had this expense refused. I purchased an iPad (249GPB) on my personal credit card which was used as a client prize for the Inflation Conference on Monday, 13 October at Winchester House. I had to buy this in person on the weekend before the conference at Currys Digital as the original purchase on team credit card via amazon was cancelled as the item was not going to arrive in time. 

Please can you confirm you will accept the expense when I resubmit my expenses. 

I have copied my line manager Anna Buset in.

"Hello,

I am trying to itemize this receipt and keep getting audited because it is $0.01 off.



I stayed at this hotel and the rate was different for each night I was there.  I ordered room service one night only, but I am unsure how to add a one night only hotel expense, everything says “per night” on the itemizations.

Can you help?

Hello GUSTAVO,

Case Comment:

Olá Gustavo,

Meu nome é José e eu sou o Analista de Suporte que estará lhe ajudando com esse caso.

Anexei ao caso a planilha excel ‘Transações.xlsx’.
Nela, você pode ver a lista de transações que correspondem às do email que você anexou.

Note que em relação à transação de ‘LOBOS HANDLING’ (a última da lista), não havia especificação de data, então enviei as que foram importadas que possuem esse fornecedor.

Da lista, a única transação que não identifiquei foi a de 869.00.
Você poderia me enviar o extrato do cartão de crédito, indicando essa transação, para que eu faça uma busca mais detalhada dessa transação?
Caso ela realmente não tenha sido enviada para o SAP Concur, terei que solicitar o reenvio por parte do banco.

Fico no aguardo de sua confirmação.
Se você tiver outras dúvidas, não hesite em entrar em contato.

Atenciosamente,

José

Thank you for your help the other day. If possible, can we setup another call for tomorrow, Monday the 6 th ? We have a few more questions that popped up today.



How do we create a new cost tracking field or make title changes to the current ones? 

There is an option to select Add, Multi-Level List, Free-form Text, and Checkbox, but it won’t let us make a selection and click Add.









Payment Manager Batch Report and Detail Expense Report 

When changes to the cost tracking fields are completed, are these two reports automatically updated or is it something that must manually be edited to reflect the change?









When trying to setup groups, we encounter a problem 

When trying to click on “Show 1 Advanced Setting” under the Capture Spend Table, nothing happens so we aren’t able to proceed with the setup.









How to limit characters on the following fields in the Expense Reports 

Report ID

Report Entry Description (Business Purpose)

Report Name









Is it possible to set up specific users for different Payment Type Batches?







Thank you,

Alen

I've updated the pricing for PSE to $1,800.00. In terms of the base fee, this is a system limitation despite PSE not having a per transaction fee.

"Hi Dhazle,

I ran the report and I think there is a misunderstanding of what I was looking for.  I was hoping to see a report with a pie chart for each employee versus one pie chart for all employees.  However, I spoke with the person requesting the report and they indicated when they worked for Red Robin, they were able to run reports themselves and it would include an excel spreadsheet with a pie chart underneath for each employee.

Are we able to create one excel sheet for each employee and each one have their own pie chart?  Or better yes, could we have one excel spreadsheet with each employee's transactions containing a subtotal and a pie chart for each of the individual employees?

All the Best,

Tony

"Hello Teresa,

Thank you for taking my call this afternoon. I appreciate your time and it was a pleasure speaking with you. As we discussed with column AG in the extract file, where the leading zeros were missing, this setting is an Excel limitation and cannot be forced when configuring custom fields in SAP Concur. By default Microsoft Excel won't display or store leading zeros. Sometimes, these entries are true numeric values and you will need to evaluate them in mathematical processes.

When this is the case, you can force Excel to display placeholder 0 digits by applying a custom format as follows:

Select the cell or range in question.


Right-click the selected cell or range and choose Format Cells from the context menu.


Click the Number tab.


Choose Custom from the Category list.


In the Type field, enter the number of 0's necessary to accommodate the largest value. For instance, if the largest value contains four digits, enter four 0's.


Click OK and Excel displays leading values.




I am sending this case up to our Expense Support Team for further review of the incorrect Employee Id on row 27 and the missing department code on row 91 in the extract file. An analyst will follow up with you shortly. Thank you for your patience.

If you have further questions or concerns, you can either reply back to this email or update this case in the Concur Support Portal.  I will receive your updates immediately via email.

Thank you. Initially they were sent successfully but with in few seconds they are disappearing from the IN directory. I have already provided those screenshots.



We can show to you also in a call and you can capture the logs why it behaves weirdly. I have been asking to schedule a call to resolve the issue quickly from the beginning of the week. But no one has sent any meeting invite.



I don’t think we can quickly resolve the issue by having emails conversations. As it is very urgent for the project timelines, we need your help to resolve it by Tomorrow. Please let me know if we can have call on PST morning or evening hours, I can send the meeting invite to you.

"Hello



My personnel number is u551194



I have been trying to submit an expense claim for a hotel charge (titled:2018 12 Madrid) which was made after a meeting was cancelled in Madrid, and therefore I did not travel, or stay at the hotel in order to receive an invoice. As a result I am struggling to obtain a duplicate invoice.



The cancellation policy on the RR rate was 24 hours prior to date of stay and unfortunately the meeting was cancelled within this time, just prior to travel commencing.



For some reason every time I add this as a comment into the expense claim it is removed, and a comment added that I need to provide a duplicate invoice, which I am struggling to obtain, all I can provide is a copy of my booking information with the cancellation policy- would this suffice?



Kind regards

Sylvia,



This is not an unusual situation when taking customers golfing and you buy drinks/snacks at the beverage cart. Your guidance on how to get a receipt would be appreciated. Much of the time only cash is accepted. Writing the amount down on the golf course scorecard had been accepted in the past.



Thanks,

"Hi Concur Team and Zack 


Here is the explanation as to data not posting to QuickBooks and the resolution.



Pivot requires that all transactions have a “Custom 02 – Employee Group” value populated, including at the Itemization and/or Allocation level in all cases. This value is a key factor for Pivot to bring the data through, as it advises which QuickBooks Company File and configuration to route the report to.



In cases it is available for all transactions in the report, Pivot is posting the data into QuickBooks successfully. We have checked that. In cases it IS NOT populated for all lines in the report, the data is not available to post into QuickBooks.



To resolve this, the Concur team needs to update the Concur configuration so that the Custom 02 – Employee Group value populates for all transactions and copies down to the Allocation Level. Pivot does not provide configuration services for Concur products.



Here are screenshots of the reported errors to explain and then under, the explanation provided the last time we saw this issue.



Example 1 - The expenses highlighted are missing the Custom 02-Employee Group value, thus causing the report to fail to come through to Pivot. In reviewing this report, it appears available for all lines with the exception of the Allocations/Itemizations







Example 2 - The expenses highlighted are missing the Custom 02-Employee Group value, thus causing the report to fail to come through to Pivot. In reviewing this report, it appears available for all lines with the exception of the Allocations/Itemizations

"Hello Anna,

Thank you for your patience.  I went into Calen Soco's user profile as a proxy and reviewed the Approval Flow in her February Expenses report. The Manager Approval field defaults by system design to search approver names by last name first.  In your attached screenshot, she typed her manager's name in as 'Scott Totman' instead of 'Totman, Scott,' which caused the error message to fire because the system did not recognize 'Scott' as a manager last name.

Simply typing in 'Totman' will allow the system to search for the manager and will return the manager's name in the search results, so it can be selected and saved to the workflow before report submission.

I've attached a Word document outlining with screenshots the steps I took to review the report's Approval Flow.  Scott Totman's name is now saved in the Manager Approval field, so Calen can now submit the report.

If you have questions or concern, please reply back to this email to let me know.

"Hi,



A recent report that I submitted has been audited with some errors that I do not know how to fix.



My company car was recently in the body shop and I was told to fill up the rental car with my corporate credit card. I have several transactions on my report that are being flagged for this reason.



The following is also flagged several times on my report… “ Another expense has been submitted with the identical air ticket number. Report: 8D5791F1CCC844B6AC31 5.17.19 Report Expense: 2019-04-05,Agency Booking Fees, 10.00 USD”…. These transaction fees were administered after booking flights.



Could you please help me with this so I can submit the report correctly?



Regards,
Bradley Meek

Thanks for reaching out about ordering with different emails! I am happy to help with managing your account :) 


If you let me know which email address is the one that you want everything to be under I can go ahead and do that for you! 


As far as the pricing of the items goes, the sales that we just ran for Black Friday and Cyber Monday applied to both subscriptions and one time orders! The current prices on the website are automatically set to subscription prices, but if you want to place a one time purchase all you have to do is move the toggle over, like in the picture I attached to this message! 


Let me know if you have any more questions, I am happy to answer them :)

Although when I did the search for unassigned transactions on myself it said none found but in my expenses there are unassigned transactions, similarly for Ed Moran.  I get the daily reminder for his expense but the search showed no results.



Any advice?

"Hi Monique,

Congratulations! We've verified the nonprofit status of Camp Read-a-Rama on Givebutter. Your account now has access to these exclusive benefits:

✅ Verification badge on your campaign pages
Donors will now see a special verification badge on your campaign pages, giving them the confidence that they are giving to the right place.

�� EIN number displayed on your email receipts
Your EIN will now be included automatically on email receipts to your donors. We also encourage you to add a , which appears on every receipt as well.

�� Access to our Text-to-Donate 5-digit short code
Instead of a 9-digit phone number, verified nonprofits have access to our short code, 53-555. The number allows you to start capturing mobile payments instantly using a completely free SMS solution.

�� Faster settlement time
Typically, all donations on Givebutter remain pending for 72 hours before they become available for withdrawal. When verified, your payments will settle in just 48 hours.

�� Automated Payouts (optional) 
Traditionally, all payouts made to your bank account need to be manually initiated from the Dashboard. For verified accounts on Givebutter, we can upgrade you to daily Automated Payouts.

�� ACH Payments (optional)
Allow your supporters to donate using their bank accounts. ACH Payments have a lower Processing Fee of 1.9% + 30¢ per transaction. That is 1% lower than all other payment methods on Givebutter!

Most benefits are enabled automatically, though and are optional, so please let us know if you'd like us to enable these two features for you by dropping us a note below. ��

We have lots more planned for verified nonprofits and as soon as we have updates you will be the first to hear about them. In the meantime, please do let us know if there's anything we can do to support your fundraising efforts.",2022-03-18 22:46:27.000000 UTC,chat,True,"Congratulations!

"Hi there,



I’m a little confused why my expense claim for my mobile phone August and September which I use for work was not paid and sent back.



Looking at the notes a request for a FBT form is mentioned, I’m not sure what an FBT form is and for my previous mobile phone bill claims for June and July an FBT form was not requested.



When I entered the expense in Concur I attached the mobile bill for the month of August and September (also attached in this email) and to my knowledge this is a Tax invoice.



Please let me know if I have missed a step in Concur when I entered this two expense claims.



Kind Regards

Thank you for contacting Pura Customer Care! My name is Jada and I will be taking over for Cache regarding your subscription and order. 


I read over the conversation and looked into your account. It looks like when you placed that order on Feb 12th containing the device, you only had two Volcano refills in the subscription. It looks like today you pushed that next subscription charge date to Feb 23rd.


You also created a second subscription today for 4 Volcano refills and the next ship date for that is March 29nd


I apologize for the confusion, are you wanting to receive 6 volcano refills a month?

"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,



ich habe in der letzten Woche die Belege & Abrechnungen für Hr. John eingereicht und wollte mal hören, ob es hier schon eine Resonanz gibt?

Ich hatte in der letzten Woche eine Meldung zu einem U-Bahnbeleg bekommen, allerdings kann ich im Moment nichts ändern.

Bitte geben Sie mir Bescheid, was Ihnen fehlt oder was Sie hierfür benötigen.



Ganz liebe Grüße,

Nadine Kuttnick

"I have had my expense report turned back to me for request of a proper receipt from a ‘vendor’.

I have explained to my work and I will tell you:  Our business dictates travel out of town for months at a time.  We rent condos at times or other long term housing.

This $2700.00 is a prepayment for 36 days of housing in a condo that I have rented for almost 3 years prior to our acquisition.

The people are in their late 70’s.  They do not rent to anyone else.  They do not have credit card machines. They only rent to me out of a friendship situation.  The receipt I created was for this purpose of turning in my expense report.  They have a copy as well.  There is no other receipt to be had in this situation.

Please reimburse as I have already paid this money out.

Thank you.
