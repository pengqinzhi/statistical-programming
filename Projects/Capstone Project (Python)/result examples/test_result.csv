Sylvia,



This is not an unusual situation when taking customers golfing and you buy drinks/snacks at the beverage cart. Your guidance on how to get a receipt would be appreciated. Much of the time only cash is accepted. Writing the amount down on the golf course scorecard had been accepted in the past.

I?€?m a little confused why my expense claim for my mobile phone August and September which I use for work was not paid and sent back.



Looking at the notes a request for a FBT form is mentioned, I?€?m not sure what an FBT form is and for my previous mobile phone bill claims for June and July an FBT form was not requested.



When I entered the expense in Concur I attached the mobile bill for the month of August and September (also attached in this email) and to my knowledge this is a Tax invoice.



Please let me know if I have missed a step in Concur when I entered this two expense claims.

Unfortunately, that is not a field that can be populated on the Report Header, or any other form, so we had to create a Custom Field (Custom 5) on the Employee Form which needs to be populated by ITG?€?s system.

We then can use that field to copy down to the Report Header Custom Field 5 which will populate your Accounting Extract.

I sincerely apologize for the technical difficulties you've described with the Hair Ball. As a livestreaming embed platform, Givebutter doesn't restrict anything like video or audio. The issue you're describing seems to be after the video was embedded into Givebutter, and the words ""Unavailable"" confirm that something was misconfigured in your YouTube settings. A common problem is restricting the embed setting on your video on the YouTube side. For example, on YouTube there is a setting called ""embed settings"" where owner of the video can decide whether or not to allow for embeds. It seems like perhaps your privacy settings via YouTube were misconfigured.

We strive to create the best user experience and are here to help you find success in digital giving. Please let me know if you have any other thoughts or recommendations on how we can help you and others be more successful in the future.

BDA has booked for total rate of GBP 862.50 that included Breakfast (Ticket and hotel confirmation attached). But the hotel billing showed breakfast separately (Voucher attached) and then they waived off any excess than GBP 862.50.



I had itemized as per provided in bill for first 4 days (Hotel room and lodging) and adjusted the remaining on 5 th day to total GBP 862.50 in concurr. It will help if someone can explain how exactly should I reflect this?

Congratulations! We've verified the nonprofit status of Camp Read-a-Rama on Givebutter. Your account now has access to these exclusive benefits:

??? Verification badge on your campaign pages
Donors will now see a special verification badge on your campaign pages, giving them the confidence that they are giving to the right place.

?????? EIN number displayed on your email receipts
Your EIN will now be included automatically on email receipts to your donors. We also encourage you to add a , which appears on every receipt as well.

?????? Access to our Text-to-Donate 5-digit short code
Instead of a 9-digit phone number, verified nonprofits have access to our short code, 53-555. The number allows you to start capturing mobile payments instantly using a completely free SMS solution.

?????? Faster settlement time
Typically, all donations on Givebutter remain pending for 72 hours before they become available for withdrawal. When verified, your payments will settle in just 48 hours.

?????? Automated Payouts (optional) 
Traditionally, all payouts made to your bank account need to be manually initiated from the Dashboard. For verified accounts on Givebutter, we can upgrade you to daily Automated Payouts.

?????? ACH Payments (optional)
Allow your supporters to donate using their bank accounts. ACH Payments have a lower Processing Fee of 1.9% + 30?? per transaction. That is 1% lower than all other payment methods on Givebutter!

Most benefits are enabled automatically, though and are optional, so please let us know if you'd like us to enable these two features for you by dropping us a note below. ??????

We have lots more planned for verified nonprofits and as soon as we have updates you will be the first to hear about them. In the meantime, please do let us know if there's anything we can do to support your fundraising efforts.",2022-03-18 22:46:27.000000 UTC,chat,TRUE,FALSE

My reply in bold



""As I have checked,the reason why there is a discrepancy on the amount that should have been credited to AMEX, its because the meals should have been included in the itemization created for the Hotel expense. Upon the creation of the Meals expenses on the report, these were created as Cash transactions, therefore the SGD 1,004.70 will be reimbursed to you instead. Only SGD 210.90 needs to be paid back to AMEX though at this point and not SGD 1,004.70.""



Am I supposed to pay AMEX first and wait for the reimbursed SGD1004.70? When will I receive the reimbursement? Please reply ASAP because the credit card deadline is end April 2016.



?€?Are you given daily allowances for meals for SGD 90.00/day??€?



Yes given



Moving forward, how to prevent this expense claims situation? The ?€? do not reimburse?€? in the concur system does not work at all when the hotels charge the room rates and meals in one single transaction.

250,"Good morning

I am somewhat surprised on your comment on this expense report ??and would like to clarify what the problems are.
May be I am not reading correctly your message because it is very difficult to understand which comments belongs to which expense as the text is written with no line return.

1. Business line
The date that is appearing on my report are either the date of the invoice or the date at which the invoice is due .?? I have used this scheme since the beginning of Concur implementation and never got any negative comment.
So which date do you want to see on the expense: my payment date, ??the date of the invoice, the date of the service invoiced or the date at which the invoice is showing as last payment date ( they are all different and valid from an accounting perspective) ?
The part charged is only the business line and not the calls. I attach the split for the business line so that you can verify this value of 35.92 for both June and August.

2. Tolls for 5???
this toll is a toll from Parc de St Cloud which is of 5???. I claimed 5 euros. So I don?€?t understand your comment.
I do not have the receipt anymore because you have it. So I include a copy of the web site which shows that the toll is indeed of 5???.
Another 5 ??? expense is ??appearing in my expense report as parking but this is a different receipt.

3. Computer peripherals for 44.75???.
This purchase is for ink cartridge for my HBO printer and batteries for my HBO mouse if I recall correctly. These have been purchased from Bureau vall??e as the Paris office was not able to provide them.

I have supplied you with the Bureau vall??e invoice which shows this total expense value of 44.75???. And I claim these 44.75???.
I don?€?t understand what is the problem with this expense. Can you clarify?

Thanks in advance

Marc

1. Business line June: orange invoice june 2015 attached
2. Business line August: orange invoice aug 2015 attached

3.Toll st cloud: see below
4. You have the bureau vall??e original invoice.

""I do not have another copy for the attached receipt; unfortunately the amount got wet & washed off but it was the same for the rest of my train travel days with new look""




The amount wouldn't have been altered seeing as I was doing work experience with new look from 9th may to 25th may doing the same journey everyday as seen on the other attached receipts.

Can this please be sorted as I do not want to continue stating the same comment claim multiple times?
