Congratulations! We've verified the nonprofit status of Camp Read-a-Rama on Givebutter. Your account now has access to these exclusive benefits:

??? Verification badge on your campaign pages
Donors will now see a special verification badge on your campaign pages, giving them the confidence that they are giving to the right place.

?????? EIN number displayed on your email receipts
Your EIN will now be included automatically on email receipts to your donors. We also encourage you to add a , which appears on every receipt as well.

?????? Access to our Text-to-Donate 5-digit short code
Instead of a 9-digit phone number, verified nonprofits have access to our short code, 53-555. The number allows you to start capturing mobile payments instantly using a completely free SMS solution.

?????? Faster settlement time
Typically, all donations on Givebutter remain pending for 72 hours before they become available for withdrawal. When verified, your payments will settle in just 48 hours.

?????? Automated Payouts (optional) 
Traditionally, all payouts made to your bank account need to be manually initiated from the Dashboard. For verified accounts on Givebutter, we can upgrade you to daily Automated Payouts.

?????? ACH Payments (optional)
Allow your supporters to donate using their bank accounts. ACH Payments have a lower Processing Fee of 1.9% + 30?? per transaction. That is 1% lower than all other payment methods on Givebutter!

Most benefits are enabled automatically, though and are optional, so please let us know if you'd like us to enable these two features for you by dropping us a note below. ??????

We have lots more planned for verified nonprofits and as soon as we have updates you will be the first to hear about them. In the meantime, please do let us know if there's anything we can do to support your fundraising efforts.",2022-03-18 22:46:27.000000 UTC,chat,TRUE,FALSE
