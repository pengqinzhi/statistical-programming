589,"Hello Teresa,

Thank you for taking my call this afternoon. I appreciate your time and it was a pleasure speaking with you. As we discussed with column AG in the extract file, where the leading zeros were missing, this setting is an Excel limitation and cannot be forced when configuring custom fields in SAP Concur. By default Microsoft Excel won't display or store leading zeros. Sometimes, these entries are true numeric values and you will need to evaluate them in mathematical processes.

When this is the case, you can force Excel to display placeholder 0 digits by applying a custom format as follows:

Select the cell or range in question.


Right-click the selected cell or range and choose Format Cells from the context menu.


Click the Number tab.


Choose Custom from the Category list.


In the Type field, enter the number of 0's necessary to accommodate the largest value. For instance, if the largest value contains four digits, enter four 0's.


Click OK and Excel displays leading values.




I am sending this case up to our Expense Support Team for further review of the incorrect Employee Id on row 27 and the missing department code on row 91 in the extract file. An analyst will follow up with you shortly. Thank you for your patience.

If you have further questions or concerns, you can either reply back to this email or update this case in the Concur Support Portal.  I will receive your updates immediately via email.

J’ai reçu plusieurs email puisque la date de transaction de mes factures ne sont pas les mêmes que les dates de réclamations demandé. Ceci est dû au fait que ma date d’embauche est le 25 septembre 2017 et que les formations de Deloitte ont été suivi durant l’été, donc avant ma date d’embauche. Quand j’ai essayé d’entrer les dates avant ma dates d’embauche le système Concur ne m’a pas l’laisser faire, donc j’ai mis la dates de ces remboursements coïncident avec ma date d’embauche.

I will be your contact for Danske Bank on this case.



The setups to Concur for DK, FI and SE are completely standard from our side. We also have Lundbeck Pharma A/S set up for Concur. We have one Delivery ID for each company, so it will be one file for each of the new companies. We cannot send the transactions as test transactions, so they will have to be test marked in Concur. As far as I know, this is not a problem.



If we are to send transactions to Concur for UK, IE, ITx2 and PLx2, then I need to know some more about the Mastercard agreements for these companies. I need to know either the Mastercard agreement number or the Mastercard account number for each of the companies to check if we are already sending data for these into Mastercard SmartData, or to set up the data feed if we are not.

Hello—

A new year offers the opportunity for a reset.

The calendar no longer feels like a countdown with time running out, but a new canvas filled with possibilities. It’s the ideal time to refresh perspectives, identify new goals, and map out the year ahead. And at the Center on Rural Innovation, the transition to 2022 has put one theme front and center:

Epic opportunity.

All too often, people talk about rural America in terms of what we don’t have. We’re moving beyond that — and we’re not alone. More organizations are waking up to the prospect that technology can spark a rural renaissance in the 21st century.

As the perfect kickoff, we announced this month that , will be the pilot site for , an initiative that will empower more rural places to benefit from everything that broadband access and the growing digital economy has to offer. This project, , came to life because the visionary leaders of our partner organizations understand that rural economies need to be strong and diversified if they hope to succeed for decades to come. They see small cities like Aberdeen as a place of opportunity, a chance to show other leaders and policymakers what the future of rural economic development can look like across the country. They believe, as we do, that the jobs of the future can and should be able to .

We’ve also seen more stories that illustrate the ways rural America is evolving and upending inaccurate stereotypes, too.

The next time you hear someone talking about how rural America isn’t diverse, you should point out that the latest Census data shows it is actually more diverse than ever: Nearly a quarter of rural residents — 24% — are people of color. This month, we spoke with NPR for a story about , where this ongoing demographic shift has resulted in a five-person city council that now has four members from its growing Latinx community. The example isn’t an outlier, either: 10% of rural counties are now majority people of color, according to .

These narrative-busting examples are essential when it comes to recognizing that rural America is not white America, as well as realizing the vibrancy and transformative potential that this diversity provides to so many rural communities.

Along the same lines, CORI, in collaboration with , released several pieces of research this month funded by the , which had the incredible foresight to ask us to dig deeper to understand where and how their resources — and the rest of the economic development community — can have the greatest impact in bringing technology jobs to . In addition to examining the economic development approaches used by around the country, there is a series of on topics like the , the , , and the geography of innovation. This work will be the focus of a virtual we are hosting on Feb. 17 — you can to be a part of this event.

Supported by new partners and amazing new communities, with new research and data to draw from, it’s truly an exhilarating moment to be working in and for rural America. The momentum is only growing. At the dawn of this new year, now is the time to make the most of this incredible opportunity.

Join the Conversation: Future-Focused
Economic Development in Rural America





On Feb. 17, we are hosting , moderated by our director of research and knowledge, Mark Rembert, that delves into how technology is changing rural economies and how local leaders are responding. And three of those leaders — Ela Kakde, Stacy Nimmo, and Kathy Wyatt — will be sharing from with future-focused rural economic development in their communities.

We hope you can to join us for the discussion!



This conversation expands on our latest research, supported by funding from into some of the trends affecting economic development in rural America. For more on some of these topics, check out the following reports released earlier this month:

: This report addresses what we have learned about remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as what remote work in rural America looked like before, how remote work changed during the pandemic, and what it may look like in the future.



: This report looks at the growth of gig and independent work, and digs into the scope, scale, opportunities, and risks of the gig economy in the context of rural America.



: Our most recent report explores the question of how automation has impacted, is impacting, and will continue to impact rural America in the coming years, and breaks down these trends across occupations, industries, places and people.

I just tried to call, but must have missed you. Divvy goes a step above what most expense management platforms are able to do, and I would love to show you the platform, and learn a little bit more about your process.
Here are some highlights of Divvy:
1. Eliminates expense reports: no more chasing down reports, receipts, or issuing reimbursements ( ).
2. Prevents overspending by ""Divvying"" money to, and assigning spenders to, budgets (hence our name).
3. Improves security with unlimited virtual credit cards (assign each vendor their own card with charge limits - ).
4. Saves on travel: we beat sites like Hotels.com and Expedia by 15-50% with .
5. 1% Cash Back on purchases
Not to mention Divvy is 100% FREE.

Thanks for reaching out to Pura, I'm sorry for the confusion with your rewards discount code!


With rewards, points can only be redeemed and used on subscription orders. Once you redeem your points, you will not have to do anything! The code will automatically be applied to your upcoming subscription order and as soon as it is processed the amount that you redeemed will be taken off.


I looked into your account and it looks like that rewards discount code RDLQ6JDF for $20 off has been applied to your subscription order set to go out Jan. 1st with two Volcano fragrances in the order.


If you would like I can remove the code and add those 400 points back back into your account. Just let me know if that works better.

Hello Audit Support,

I received the attached comment regarding my expense statement. The rental car costs were rejected with the reason, that renting a GPS is not allowed. I believe that this is wrong.

Please take a look at page 4 of the travel policy (see attachment). There it is stated, that renting a GPS is allowed if required for safety reasons. This was the case because I was travelling in a foreign country and needed the guidance.

Please approve my expense statement.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Best Regards,

Me again, still have questions about the expense reports transferring to QB.

I have just approved William Everhart's July expense report, closed the batch, sent the data, updated the ""Concur Connect"" in QB, but I am still not seeing any of Will's expenses in the Amex expenses, the Chase expenses are in QB. The information from Payment Manager says that $2,994.89 has been sent, but Will's expense report for July was $6,129.88, the Amex expenses of $3,131.99 are missing.

Thanks for contacting Pura Customer Care. My name is Nicole and I'll be helping you out today!




I'm so sorry to hear that you are missing some items from your order, I'm happy to help you find or replace these fragrances.




The fragrances you ordered should be found on the right side of the device box. Each box holds up to 4 fragrances, often times fragrances are packaged underneath each other. Especially under the white flap, there is a tab you can use to pull this flap out (please see attached diagram).




Can I have you send me a picture of everything taken out of the right side of each box?




﻿If the fragrances are not hiding under the flap or each other, then we can go ahead and move forward with the replacements ASAP.




Thanks!

730,"Hello Anna,

Thank you for your patience.  I went into Calen Soco's user profile as a proxy and reviewed the Approval Flow in her February Expenses report. The Manager Approval field defaults by system design to search approver names by last name first.  In your attached screenshot, she typed her manager's name in as 'Scott Totman' instead of 'Totman, Scott,' which caused the error message to fire because the system did not recognize 'Scott' as a manager last name.

Simply typing in 'Totman' will allow the system to search for the manager and will return the manager's name in the search results, so it can be selected and saved to the workflow before report submission.

I've attached a Word document outlining with screenshots the steps I took to review the report's Approval Flow.  Scott Totman's name is now saved in the Manager Approval field, so Calen can now submit the report.

If you have questions or concern, please reply back to this email to let me know.

Thank you,

718,"Hi Concur Team and Zack 


Here is the explanation as to data not posting to QuickBooks and the resolution.



Pivot requires that all transactions have a “Custom 02 – Employee Group” value populated, including at the Itemization and/or Allocation level in all cases. This value is a key factor for Pivot to bring the data through, as it advises which QuickBooks Company File and configuration to route the report to.



In cases it is available for all transactions in the report, Pivot is posting the data into QuickBooks successfully. We have checked that. In cases it IS NOT populated for all lines in the report, the data is not available to post into QuickBooks.



To resolve this, the Concur team needs to update the Concur configuration so that the Custom 02 – Employee Group value populates for all transactions and copies down to the Allocation Level. Pivot does not provide configuration services for Concur products.



Here are screenshots of the reported errors to explain and then under, the explanation provided the last time we saw this issue.

Hi there 

I have had this expense refused. I purchased an iPad (249GPB) on my personal credit card which was used as a client prize for the Inflation Conference on Monday, 13 October at Winchester House. I had to buy this in person on the weekend before the conference at Currys Digital as the original purchase on team credit card via amazon was cancelled as the item was not going to arrive in time. 

Please can you confirm you will accept the expense when I resubmit my expenses. 

I have copied my line manager Anna Buset in.

Thank you for contacting Pura Customer Care! My name is Jada and I will be taking over for Cache regarding your subscription and order. 


I read over the conversation and looked into your account. It looks like when you placed that order on Feb 12th containing the device, you only had two Volcano refills in the subscription. It looks like today you pushed that next subscription charge date to Feb 23rd.


You also created a second subscription today for 4 Volcano refills and the next ship date for that is March 29nd

I have updated the itemized report with check in/check out dates each time and the correct receipt attached. Each time I save the report with the check in dates listed as 2/24 check in, 2/25 check out, the report then updates the transaction date to 2/24/20 which is not accurate. The transaction dates was 2/12/20 and the check in dates is 2/24 with check out happening 2/25/20. This appears to be a bug in your software and it's kicking back the report every time I submit.

Is it possible to either prevent users from editing the tax amount in Australia and Singapore or to allow users to edit the tax amount in Canada?

- Yes, it is possible to modify those request on our back end. Just let me know should you want employees to modify tax or not. And please note that changes will always apply moving forward also, make sure that there's no on-going reports because it will be affected by the system change.

...at least get your $100 for completing a demo of .

I’ve tried to reach you a few times to schedule a time for the Divvy demo you requested. We really want to help your company eliminate expense reports but haven’t heard back, which tells me one of three things:

You’re all set, enjoy doing expense reports and I should stop bothering you. (If so, let me know)

You’re still interested but haven’t had the time to get back to me yet. In that case,

You’ve fallen and can’t get up. In that case, please let me know and I’ll call someone to help. :)



I look forward to saving your organization money, saving you time, and making you look great!

In the meantime, here are two short videos you can review to prepare for our call:

My personnel number is u551194



I have been trying to submit an expense claim for a hotel charge (titled:2018 12 Madrid) which was made after a meeting was cancelled in Madrid, and therefore I did not travel, or stay at the hotel in order to receive an invoice. As a result I am struggling to obtain a duplicate invoice.



The cancellation policy on the RR rate was 24 hours prior to date of stay and unfortunately the meeting was cancelled within this time, just prior to travel commencing.



For some reason every time I add this as a comment into the expense claim it is removed, and a comment added that I need to provide a duplicate invoice, which I am struggling to obtain, all I can provide is a copy of my booking information with the cancellation policy- would this suffice?



Kind regards

A recent report that I submitted has been audited with some errors that I do not know how to fix.



My company car was recently in the body shop and I was told to fill up the rental car with my corporate credit card. I have several transactions on my report that are being flagged for this reason.



The following is also flagged several times on my report… “ Another expense has been submitted with the identical air ticket number. Report: 8D5791F1CCC844B6AC31 5.17.19 Report Expense: 2019-04-05,Agency Booking Fees, 10.00 USD”…. These transaction fees were administered after booking flights.



Could you please help me with this so I can submit the report correctly?

ich habe bei Concur eine Netto-Abrechnung eingestellt, bei der ich für eine Gruppe von GRT-Mitarbeitern, welche sich auf einer Messe befanden, Wasser und Snacks gekauft habe. Allerdings wurden auf der Rechnung 2 verschiedene Mehrwertsteuern angegeben. Die Abrechnung mit 19% Mwst. hat nicht funktioniert und die Abrechnung mit 7% Mwst. auch nicht!

Wie ist da der korrekte Vorgang? Können Sie mir weiterhelfen.



Des Weiteren ist bei einer anderen Abrechnung die Fehlermeldung „Buchung fehlgeschlagen. Detaillierte Fehlermeldungen finden Sie im Prüfpfad.“ Wieso? Verstehe die Systemmeldungen nicht! Und vor allem nicht, wie ich das beheben kann.



Über eine schnelle Antwort freue ich mich!

Hello GUSTAVO,

We have commented on your case (16406389). Please find the details below:

Case Comment:

Olá Gustavo,

Meu nome é José e eu sou o Analista de Suporte que estará lhe ajudando com esse caso.

Anexei ao caso a planilha excel ‘Transações.xlsx’.
Nela, você pode ver a lista de transações que correspondem às do email que você anexou.

Note que em relação à transação de ‘LOBOS HANDLING’ (a última da lista), não havia especificação de data, então enviei as que foram importadas que possuem esse fornecedor.

Da lista, a única transação que não identifiquei foi a de 869.00.
Você poderia me enviar o extrato do cartão de crédito, indicando essa transação, para que eu faça uma busca mais detalhada dessa transação?

Thank you for your help the other day. If possible, can we setup another call for tomorrow, Monday the 6 th ? We have a few more questions that popped up today.



How do we create a new cost tracking field or make title changes to the current ones? 

There is an option to select Add, Multi-Level List, Free-form Text, and Checkbox, but it won’t let us make a selection and click Add.









Payment Manager Batch Report and Detail Expense Report 

When changes to the cost tracking fields are completed, are these two reports automatically updated or is it something that must manually be edited to reflect the change?









When trying to setup groups, we encounter a problem 

When trying to click on “Show 1 Advanced Setting” under the Capture Spend Table, nothing happens so we aren’t able to proceed with the setup.









How to limit characters on the following fields in the Expense Reports 

Report ID

Report Entry Description (Business Purpose)

Report Name









Is it possible to set up specific users for different Payment Type Batches?







Thank you,

Alen

355,"Hi Mark,

Be on the lookout for a $100 Divvy credit card in the next few days. I just sent it out in the mail this week. Follow the instructions in the card to spend the money. Eager to have you experience Divvy! We are helping companies, like Cache Valley Electric, overcome challenges with expense management:

- Tracking down receipts
- Lack of big picture financial visibility
- Not knowing who is using or where the corporate cards are being spent
- Potential fraud due to the high number of vendors your CC is attached to

By the way, our software is 100% free. Seriously.

Enjoy!

1. any update on possibility of a demo session ?

3. Base on file attached showing the different rate for each expense type, please assist to set them up on  test instance of Concur so that we could used for this UAT testing to confirm functionality.

Question : in the event that Receipt Domestic multiple at expense line is selected, will it allow itemisation by 8% & 10%

4. the above should be set up in the system to calculate only domestic tax.

5. Using our attachment for item 3 above, we have set some expense types only has a single rate then Concur will code that rate for that expense type to always calculate that rate just like it does today where the user enters gross amount and the tax is calculated. The receipt type would not change how it is calculated but what if user do not have a receipt, then we should not be apply the tax rate. In such scenario, does it mean that ""no receipt"" has to be selected. thus the field for selecting rate/receipt type would has to be visible to the users for these expense type. Depend your answer or advice then we would decides if need to set 5 or 3* receipt types below.

Receipt Domestic multiple*;

Receipt Domestic 8%;

Receipt  Domestic 10%;

Receipt International; / Receipt*

No Receipt*

I ran the report and I think there is a misunderstanding of what I was looking for.  I was hoping to see a report with a pie chart for each employee versus one pie chart for all employees.  However, I spoke with the person requesting the report and they indicated when they worked for Red Robin, they were able to run reports themselves and it would include an excel spreadsheet with a pie chart underneath for each employee.

Are we able to create one excel sheet for each employee and each one have their own pie chart?  Or better yes, could we have one excel spreadsheet with each employee's transactions containing a subtotal and a pie chart for each of the individual employees?

All the Best,

I will attach the instructions below so that you can quickly and easily reauthorize multiple usernames, to get back to creating your beautiful Chatbooks. Reauthorizing usually works best when using a computer vs. your phone and preferably from a Google Chrome or Firefox Internet browser. 1. Here is the link to reauthorize your dalynnwthomas username. Click the below link and login using the above username and your password. http://app.chatbooks.com/reconnect/5254277/rsp2zz8v8OR6a85TSvFp9XZ8QFrWNB7UweN1W6Gw  2. Make sure that your littletopknots username has its own password and isn't attached to the 1st account's password. To do this:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Please open your Instagram app and login to the account that you would like connected to Chatbooks. b. Click the person icon in the bottom right hand corner. Make sure that you click the username at the top and toggle to the correct new username that you want connected. Then tap the hamburger menu (the three horizontal lines) in the top right corner. c.Click settings, then security. d. You may see &ldquo;create password&rdquo; at the top of the list. If so, please click it and create a password.  3. Go to&nbsp;Instagram.com (http://instagram.com/)&nbsp;from your computer browser and make sure you are logged out. 4. Now that you are completely logged out from Instagram, try this link for your (insert 2nd username). To ensure that it doesn't automatically log you back into your main account, you could even try opening a private/incognito browser window to copy/paste the below link into. Log in using the username (not the email) and new password that you just created.  http://app.chatbooks.com/reconnect/5254278/rsp2zz8v8OR6a85TSvFp9XZ8QFrWNB7UweN1W6Gw  Please follow the same steps for username #2 to reauthorize username normantheakita.
