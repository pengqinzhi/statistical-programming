a. Implement and analyze existing learning algorithms, including well-studied methods
for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, and representation
learning
b. Integrate multiple facets of practical machine learning in a single system: data
preprocessing, learning, regularization and model selection
c. Describe the the formal properties of models and algorithms for learning and explain
the practical implications of those results
d. Compare and contrast different paradigms for learning (supervised, unsupervised,
etc.)
e. Design experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques
on real-world problems
f. Employ probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and optimization in order to
develop new predictive models or learning methods
g. Given a description of a ML technique, analyze it to identify (1) the expressive power
of the formalism; (2) the inductive bias implicit in the algorithm; (3) the size and
complexity of the search space; (4) the computational properties of the algorithm: (5)
any guarantees (or lack thereof) regarding termination, convergence, correctness,
accuracy or generalization power.
